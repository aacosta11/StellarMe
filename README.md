## Vision

provide an all in one platform for transacting on the stellar network.

key feats:

- messaging
- key management
- decentralized market trading

---

full vision:

- profile creation
- chatting
- iMessage support
- iMessage stickers
- DEX trading
- 3rd party wallet support
- custodial wallet. ideally a separate service called StellarYu
- web extension for checkout processing
- support on all major platforms, as an application and as a web service

vision for project week:

- [ ] profile creation
- [x] make testnet accounts with horizon api
- [ ] store public&private keys into db
- [x] send, recieve payments (testnet)
- [x] display balance (testnet)
- [ ] albedo wallet integration

Storing sensitive data

>ensure sensitive data is encrypted using a proven cipher like AES-256, and stored separately from application data and always pick an >AEAD mode. Any communication between the application server and secret server should be in a private network and / or authenticated >via HMAC. Your cipher strategy will change based on whether you will be sending the ciphertext over the wire multiple times. Finally, >back up any encryption keys you may use offline, and store them only in-memory in your app.
>
>Consult a good cryptographer and read up on best practices. A good place to start is looking into the documentation of your favorite >web framework.

Monitoring

- just check your logs for weird behavior

Authentication weaknesses

- how to add auth: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-login-authentication-to-react-applications
- or: https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/
- Time-tested passowrd hashing
- 2FA, U2F, TOTP

Denial of Service Attacks (DOS)

- implement proof of work checks in your client
- or use services like Cloudfare: https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/

Lock down unused ports

- how to do on AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html

Phishing and social engineering

- give users clear policies, how to check for legitimacy of emails, etc.

Scan your website and libraries for vulnerabilities

- Snyk tool: https://snyk.io/

SQL Injections

- Have inputs filtered, and validated
